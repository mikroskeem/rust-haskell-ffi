# rust-haskell-ffi

An experiment to link Haskell library into Rust program

## Things to do
- [ ] Figure out how to set rpath properly on macOS
- [ ] bindgen
- [ ] Static linking
    - On macOS, use pkg-config etc. to get gmp, libffi & libiconv
    - On Linux, figure out how to build PIE Haskell static library
